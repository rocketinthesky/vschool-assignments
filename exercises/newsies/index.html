<!-- You are going to recreate the front page of a newspaper using block and inline elements

Your newspaper should have:

A header with the name of your newspaper

A title for the front page article

A three columned body using p tags. (Hint: you will need to alter the display characteristic.)

Several words in the body should be individually styled using inline elements. (i.e. highlighting, bolding, or text-color change)

An image within the body of the article.

Come up with your own story. It can be anything, including satire or the recreation of an existing article somewhere. Make sure it looks nice so that someone could obviously tell it's suppose to be a newspaper. -->

    <h3>It's not what it sounds like.</h3>
        <p>
          My mother used to be <strong>addicted</strong> to the thrift store. She went every week for no purpose other than to browse for deals. Of course she found deals, being the shrewd and careful shopper that she is -- gold earrings, fine china sets, silverware, high-quality linens, kitchen appliances, to name a few. The problem was that these deals came home. They filled the house, packing shelves and occupying counter space, to the point of feeling cramped.

          Several years ago, I said to my mother in frustration, <em>"It would be a nightmare to have to deal with all this stuff if you died tomorrow."</em> She looked at me, stunned. Up until then, I suspect she'd assumed that everyone appreciated her junk-treasures as much as she did. What ensued, mercifully, was a house purge. Mom removed much of her stuff and ceased her weekly pilgrimages to the thrift store, avoiding temptation.

          That conversation revealed to me the importance of discussing the long-term intentions for one's belongings. If I hadn't said anything, I suspect it would have been decades before my 50-something-year-old mother realized what a burden her stuff would be on the family someday -- and just think of all the additional things she could've accumulated in that time. It makes me shiver.
